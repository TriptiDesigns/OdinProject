      French toast is a timeless breakfast classic that’s both comforting and
      indulgent. Made by dipping slices of bread into a sweet, eggy custard and
      then pan-frying them to golden perfection, French toast offers a rich,
      soft interior and a slightly crispy exterior. It’s an ideal way to start
      the day, especially when topped with fresh fruits, syrup, or a sprinkle of
      powdered sugar.

      Its origins can be traced back to ancient times when people repurposed
      stale bread into a tasty meal. Today, it’s enjoyed worldwide with many
      regional variations. Whether served sweet with cinnamon and berries or
      savory with cheese and herbs, French toast is a versatile and satisfying
      dish.
