      Waffles are a delightful breakfast treat known for their crisp exterior
      and soft, fluffy interior. Cooked in a waffle iron, they have a
      characteristic grid pattern that holds toppings like syrup, fruit, or
      whipped cream beautifully. Waffles can be made sweet or savory and are
      perfect for weekend brunches or special occasions.

      Originating in Europe, particularly Belgium, waffles have gained global
      popularity thanks to their texture and customizability. Whether enjoyed
      with just a drizzle of honey or loaded with toppings, waffles are a
      satisfying and visually appealing addition to any breakfast table.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1¾ cups milk</li>
      <li>½ cup melted butter (or vegetable oil)</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, beat the eggs, then mix in the milk, melted butter, and
        vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir just until
        combined. Do not overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or brush with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour enough batter into the waffle iron to just cover the waffle grid
        and close the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until the waffle is golden and crisp (typically 4–5 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and serve warm with toppings like maple syrup, whipped cream,
        fruit, or chocolate chips.
